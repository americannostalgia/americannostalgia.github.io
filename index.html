								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>M*AS*H is the story of three doctors who are stationed in South Korea during the Korean War(1950-1953). The show was extremely popular during the 1970's, so popular it's seris finale became the most watched and highest rated episode of television of it's time, with 125 million viewers. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>M*A*SH aired two decades after the end of the Korean War, meaning many of the viwers were likely alive during the war and could relate to it in someway. I find it unlikely that traditional causes of nostalgia, like longing for the better time applyed here. The show focus was comedy, Making light of a bad situation may have allowed people to beleive that the war wasn't as bad as they remembered it.  </p>

							<h2>Happy Days</h2>
							<p>Aired: 1974-1983</p>
						</header>
						<p>Happy Days is a family sitcom set in the mid 1950's and was one of the most popular shows during the 70's. The show aired two decades after the time period it was set it and was a family oriented story with a coming of age back story to it. The characters grow up over time and the family chnages. The decade in between when the the show takes place and when it was aired, was a time of massive change for america. Titleing the show happy days alludes to the 50's being a better time than the 70's. Some people may have felt that way and were nostalgic for that reason, other may have grown up in the fifites just like the characters on screen were doing. There was more than one reason this shoe was popular.  </p>

									<p>The show's themes are much different than that of other shows I've examined. Viewers clealy never lived in this time and are likely experiencing 2nd hand nostalgia of some sort. The shows main draw is that it brings an other wise inaccessable piece of history to life.</p>

						</header>
						<p>New York in the 1960's seemed like a great place to be in the Ad industry. This is the story of Don Draper, an advertising executive, and his team. The show's themes consist of drinking, sex, relationship drama, and 1960's america gender roles. The show depicts many major historical events as the plot progresses. Airing long after the shows events occured, the twnety year rule cannot be applied. The shows audience is of a younger demographic, people who never experienced the 60's and are eager to consume it second hand.</p>

							<h2>Is there a formula to creating Nostalgic Televsion?</h2>
							
						</header>
						<p></p>
					<p>Americans have proven to be an oddly nostalgic society. We are told that we live in the most advanced country in the world where life has never been better, yet we look to the past frequently. Time and time again media is produced that allows us glimpse into what life used to be like, twenty years ago or even decades ago. We swallow it up every time. We cannot resist the urge to feel like we knew what the past was like, or to experience the times of relatives did. So is there a formula to creating nostalgic television? No, well kind of. From examining these shows two major patterns become clear. One is the more reliable method, the other the boom or bust method. The reliable method is simple; create a show about high school students or young adults coming of age. The show must be comedic; paint the era it takes place in as a golden age, and most importantly must take place twenty years prior. The boom or bust method isn't as guaranteed but can captivate audiences in ways the reliable method cannot. This method requires the story of adults, not teens. The characters must have secrets and be willing to behave badly. The time period must also instill the audience with a 'you weren't here and look at what you missed feeling'. Overall there is no one way to create nostalgic TV, but there are a couple battled tested methods.</p>
